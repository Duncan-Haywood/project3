*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.*

This project involved creating a grocery item tracking program that reads purchased items from a file and allows looking up frequencies, printing all items and frequencies, and viewing a histogram. The goal was efficiently tracking grocery purchase histories.

*What did you do particularly well?*

I implemented the core functionality like loading data, saving data, and the menu options well. The program successfully tracks and reports the item frequencies as expected.

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?*

Some areas for improvement are adding more input validation and error handling for bad file input or invalid menu choices. I could also enhance the text formatting to make the printed outputs more readable. These improvements would make the code more robust and user-friendly.

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?*

The most challenging parts were handling case insensitive lookups and getting the histogram printout formatted properly. I overcame these by using a separate lowercase map for lookups. Online C++ resources helped with the formatting.

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?*

This strengthened skills in file I/O, string processing, maps, OOP class design, and debugging that I can apply to future data processing projects.

*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?* 

I used a class for encapsulation, descriptive names, and comments to make the code readable and maintainable.
